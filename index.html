            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Proper and good education is very important for all of us. It
                facilitates quality learning all through the life among people of any age group, cast, creed, religion
                and region. It is the process of achieving knowledge, values, skills, beliefs, and moral habits. People
                need to get high level awareness about the importance of knowledge more than before. Education is very
                necessary for each and everyone in order to improve knowledge, way of living as well as social and
                economic status throughout the life. Getting proper education is the birth rights of everyone
                restricting which is the crime. Education is the ultimate way to get victory over all the personal and
                social problems. Education is very important to all of us as it plays very important roles in our life.
                In order to live a better and peaceful life, we need to be educated. It transforms us completely from
                inside and outside by changing our mind and personality as well as improving our confidence level. It
                changes our life completely as it is constructive in nature.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">ILLITERACY The inability to read or write, or the actual or perceived
                state of being uneducated or insufficiently educated. Social judgement is so powerfully built into the
                term ILLITERATE that scholars now generally use more neutral terms, such as non-literate (for societies
                and individuals for whom literacy is not a relevant issue) and pre-literate (for societies and
                conditions before LITERACY emerged or was encountered and adopted). Formerly, the term illiterate was
                used to describe someone without book learning or a liberal EDUCATION (especially in classical LATIN and
                GREEK), even though such a person could read in a vernacular language or handle accounts and
                correspondence. However, the word also carried the connotation of ‘unpolished’, ‘ignorant’, or
                ‘inferior’, as in ‘the disadvantage of an illiterate education’ ( Edward Gibbon, The Decline and Fall of
                the Roman Empire, volume 2, 1781, p. 75). </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The new curriculum structure for inculcating scientific temper is a
                welcome to step in the right direction. The proposal of the National Research Foundation is well
                received but calls for encouraging policy implication oriented research. There is a need for research on
                educational products and the students as consumers in the educational industry. There should be a
                complete ban on private coaching in Kota and elsewhere. We have to ensure stopping non-attending classes
                by the private players. Common Entrance Test for admissions in the universities and colleges can do
                wonders in achieving the targets and objectives. The e-courses in 8 Languages are fine.
                There is a need for the cooperation of the State Governments without any politics as education is on the
                concurrent list. At the same time, we should be vigilant of the bureaucracy to put hurdles in quick
                implementation. </p>
